Here I show my final degree project for my Electrical Engineering degree, speciality in Telematics. I defended it in October, 2020, at School of Telecommunication Engineering in MÃ¡laga, Spain.

The project topic is about the perfomance and evaluation of the multistreaming service "Restream". The memory is written fully in Spanish.

In this work, I investigate the performance of the multistreaming platform Restream, with the ultimate goal of evaluating its operation with respect to the case of direct streaming towards conventional platforms like Twitch, YouTube or Facebook Live. I design and implement a testbench based on the technical recommendations by Cisco and Amazon, that allowed me to evaluate the effect of non-ideal network conditions on the end-to-end latency and the quality of experience.
