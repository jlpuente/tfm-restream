In this report I show my final degree work for my electrical engineering degree, speciality in telematics. I defended it on October, 2020, at Escuela Ténica Superior de Ingeniería de Telecomunicación in Málaga, Spain.

My work is about the perfomance and evaluation of the multistreaming service "Restream" and it's written in Spanish.

In this work, I investigate the performance of the multistreaming platform Restream, with the ultimate goal of evaluating its operation with respect to the case of direct streaming towards conventional platforms like Twitch, YouTube or Facebook Live. We design and implement a testbed based on the technical recommendations by Cisco and Amazon, that allows us to evaluate the effect of non-ideal network conditions on the end-to-end latency and the quality of experience.
